     * 1. Checks if the neuron has any incoming connections. If none are present, the computation is skipped.
     * 2. Calculates the weighted sum of incoming connection values using their respective weights.
     * 3. Applies the activation function to the weighted sum to determine the neuronâ€™s activation value.
     * 4. Adjusts the activation value based on a memory decay factor, blending it with the prior activation value.
     * 5. Updates the previous activation value to reflect the current activation value for the next iteration.
